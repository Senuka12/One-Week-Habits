# One Week Habits
Habits for a new you

One Week Habits is an Alexa Skill with which you can try out different habits for self-improvement.
After taking on a habit, the One Week Habits skill sets reminders on the Alexa device for the next 7 days to remind you to do the task.
Then some advice on how to do it is given.
Currently there are 4 habits:-
1. Early Bird Week - Wake up 1 hour earlier
2. Family Week - Spend time with your family
3. Music Week - Listen to music for 30 minutes
4. Tidy Up Week - Clean 7 places in the house on the 7 days.


Please Note:
The whole code might not be available as the skill was built on Voiceflow.
However the custom code added and the APL code is available in this Github Repository.

A YouTube video demoing the project and explaining it will be attached with the Devpost Submission.
